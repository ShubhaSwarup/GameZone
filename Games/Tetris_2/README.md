Tetris Game Description

The Tetris game is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to manipulate falling blocks called tetrominoes to create complete rows without any gaps. Here is a description of a Tetris game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Game Mechanics

The game consists of a rectangular playfield where tetrominoes fall from the top.
Tetrominoes are geometric shapes made up of four square blocks. The shapes include the I, J, L, O, S, T, and Z tetrominoes.
The player can control the movement of the falling tetrominoes using the keyboard arrow keys (left, right, down) to move them horizontally or vertically.
The player can also rotate the tetrominoes using the up arrow key to change their orientation.
The objective is to manipulate the tetrominoes to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps.
When a complete line is formed, it is cleared from the playfield, and the player earns points.
As the game progresses, the falling speed of the tetrominoes increases, providing a greater challenge to the player.
Game Components

HTML Structure: The game is built using HTML elements to create the playfield, score display, and game controls.
CSS Styling: CSS is used to style the game elements, including the tetromino shapes, background, and user interface components.
JavaScript Logic: JavaScript is responsible for the game's functionality and interactivity.
Tetromino Movement: JavaScript code handles the movement of the falling tetrominoes based on user input and the game's logic.
Collision Detection: The code checks for collisions between the falling tetrominoes and the playfield boundaries or existing blocks.
Line Clearing: When a complete line is formed, JavaScript code removes the line and shifts the blocks above it down.
Game Over: The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the playfield, indicating no space for new tetrominoes.
Game Controls

Left Arrow: Moves the falling tetromino to the left.
Right Arrow: Moves the falling tetromino to the right.
Down Arrow: Accelerates the falling speed of the tetromino.
Up Arrow: Rotates the falling tetromino clockwise.
Scoring and Leveling

Points: The player earns points for each completed line. The more lines cleared simultaneously, the higher the score.
Leveling: As the player earns more points or clears a certain number of lines, the game progresses to higher levels, increasing the falling speed of the tetrominoes and raising the difficulty.
Game Over and Restart

When the stack of blocks reaches the top of the playfield, the game ends.
The player is presented with a "Game Over" message and their final score.
They can choose to restart the game by clicking a "Restart" button.
By combining HTML for the structure, CSS for the visual styling, and JavaScript for the game logic and interactivity, you can create an engaging and enjoyable Tetris game that provides a nostalgic gaming experience for players.
